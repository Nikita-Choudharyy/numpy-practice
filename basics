# NumPy Basics

This folder contains basic NumPy practice programs to build a strong foundation for Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Topics Covered
- Creating NumPy arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Basic array operations
- Shape, size, and data types
- Simple numerical computations

## Purpose
The goal of this folder is to understand how NumPy works internally and how it is used for efficient numerical computation in ML and Data Science workflows.

📌 More advanced NumPy topics will be added gradually.
