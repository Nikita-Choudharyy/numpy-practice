## 🎯 Why NumPy?

NumPy is the core library for numerical computing in Python.
It is heavily used in:

* Data Analysis
* Machine Learning
* Deep Learning
* Scientific Computing

A strong understanding of NumPy is essential before moving to libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow**.
